# Xdg user directories

User directories are a set of common directories such as downloads directory, music directory, documents directory, and so on. These directories can have special identifying icons and used internally by many applications such as Nautilus and Thunar to determine where to look for files to be passed to the Create Document context menu, whereas the desktop directory is used by Xfdesktop to find .desktop files to be shown on the Desktop.
