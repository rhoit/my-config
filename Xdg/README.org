* Xdg user directories

  User directories are a set of common directories such as downloads
  directory, music directory, documents directory, and so on. These
  directories can have special identifying icons and used internally
  by many applications such as Nautilus and Thunar to determine where
  to look for files to be passed to the Create Document context menu,
  whereas the desktop directory is used by Xfdesktop to find .desktop
  files to be shown on the Desktop. [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xdg_user_directories][more info]]
