*shell* configuration, alias, coloring, git integration for zsh and
bash.

* How does it works?

  The =~/.bashrc= and =~/.zshrc= loads the available config's from
  =~/.shellrc.d= when the shell starts. Its achived by adding one
  more level of *re-direction*.

  Here is the *Summary* of snippets in [[shellrc.d][shellrc.d]].

  | file        | description                                           | sourced |
  |-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+---------|
  | arch.sh     | application releated to archlinux                     | ✓       |
  | tricks.sh   | handy *aliases* for basic commands and enable *color* | ✓       |
  | docker.sh   | shorthand for docker and fit output to 80 cols        | ✓       |
  | extract.sh  | uncompressed files accord to their *extensions*       | ✓       |
  | network.sh  | things related to *networking* & *proxies*            | ✓       |
  | picPaste.sh | *upload* images to [[http://www.picpaste.com][picpaste.com]]                       | ✓       |
  | rho.sh      | my personal preferences                               | ✓       |
  | showterm.sh | *record* your terminal and *upload* to [[https://www.showterm.io][showterm.io]]    | ✗       |
